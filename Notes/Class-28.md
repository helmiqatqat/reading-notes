# Component Lifecycle / useEffect Hook

## useEffect hook

**What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?**

The useEffect hook is part of React's Hooks API, introduced in React 16.8. Its primary purpose is to enable side effects in functional components. Side effects can be anything that interacts outside of the React component rendering mechanism: data fetching, setting up subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, using timers, etc. Prior to hooks, side effects were mostly handled in lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components.

**How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?**

The logic inside the useEffect hook runs after the component renders. Depending on its dependencies (which we provide in the second argument of the useEffect), it can run:

After every render (when no dependency array is provided).
Once after the initial render (similar to componentDidMount in class components), when an empty dependency array ([]) is provided.
When certain values change (values specified in the dependency array). This can be likened to componentDidUpdate checking for specific prop or state changes in class components.
Importantly, because the effect runs after the component renders, it does not block the browser from updating the screen. This lets our application remain responsive.

**What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?**

The function passed to useEffect can optionally return a cleanup function. This cleanup function runs when:

The component is unmounted (similar to componentWillUnmount in class components).
Before re-running the effect due to a change in its dependencies.
This cleanup is essential for preventing memory leaks and ensuring that side effects (like subscriptions or timers) are properly cleaned up before reinitializing or when the component is removed from the UI.
