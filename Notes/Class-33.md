## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

**What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?**
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

**Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.**
Through RBAC, you can control what end-users can do at both broad and granular levels. You can designate whether the user is an administrator, a specialist user, or an end-user, and align roles and access permissions with your employeesâ€™ positions in the organization. Permissions are allocated only with enough access as needed for employees to do their jobs.

**What are the Benefits of RBAC?**

1. Reducing administrative work and IT support.
2. Maximizing operational efficiency.
3. Improving compliance.
